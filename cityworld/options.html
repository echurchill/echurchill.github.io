<h2>Options</h2>

<p>A Config.yml file is generated when CityWorld first runs and each time it is told to create a new world. 
These options only affect &quot;new generation&quot;, changing them after a world has been generated will produce some odd results.</p>

<p>I have tried to ensure these options all work together but the number of permutations are pretty large. 
Also some options are exclusive of other options, for example if you decide to not include buildings 
then asking for the buildings, that you have excluded, to be decayed does not make much sense.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is what I normally do when creating a new world. It is a little awkward but it works for me.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Startup your server and create the new world (via whatever technique you like), 
	remember to read the <a href="http://echurch.github.io/cityworld/installation.html">Installation</a> instructions, 
	this will make CityWorld generate the associated configuration section in <code>plugins/CityWorld/config.yml</code>.</li>
	<li>Next I shut down the server go change those newly created settings to what I really want the world to be like.</li>
	<li>Then I delete the previously created world and restart my server. 
	If all goes well the newly created world should be regenerated but now using those new options I picked.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are wanting to create a particular <a href="http://echurch.github.io/cityworld/styles.html">world style</a>, 
like floating, take a look at the <a href="http://echurch.github.io/cityworld/installation">Installation</a> instructions. 
Note: that certain world styles will turn off/on some of the options listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>If you regenerate the world using the same version, options and seed (how you set this depends on your multiverse manager works), 
	you should get a nearly identical world, where only foliage might change. Keep in mind when there is a CityWorld version change, 
	all bets are off though. Similar seeds might/will generated wholly new worlds.</li>
	<li>Two worlds with the same seed but slightly different options very well could create very similar worlds. 
	For example, assuming the seed and all other options are the same, two worlds only differing in the inclusion of the 
	IncludeDecayedBuildings option will create two parallel worlds: One normal, one destroyed.</li>
	<li>If you generate a new world there might not be a city nearby (or mountains, or seas, etc.). 
	That is the nature of Random. If you do not like what you get, trash the world and generate a new one (with a different seed). 
	Keep in mind though, the city of your dreams might be just on the other side of that mountain so go forth and explore!</li>
	<li><i>Except where otherwise stated, all options default to true and simply control the inclusion or exclusion of a certain feature or not.</i></li>
</ul>
