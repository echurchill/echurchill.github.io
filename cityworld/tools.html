<h1>Following is a list of the tools I use for this project...</h1>

<p><a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/"><strong>WorldEdit</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the better tools for creating schematics</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org"><strong>Eclipse</strong></a></p>

<p>Great editor for Java projects</p>

<p><a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The source repository of choice, I like it so much I put my stuff there</p>

<p><a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net">FindBugs</a></p>

<p>This plugin keeps my code honest. The first time I used this it found so much stuff it took me a week to refactor everything. I learned a lot from what it found and the explanations it gave. Great Stuff Indeed!</p>

<p>While this is an odd name for a code profiler, it works great. In the past I found tools like this to be a pain to set up and get working with my code but this one worked first time out the door. Keep in mind that I am profiling a plugin (CityWorld) to a variant (Spigot) of a mod (Bukkit) to a server (MineCraft) while I played with a client (MineCraft). Crazy eh! They also support open source projects with a free license. So cool!</p>
